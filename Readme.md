# Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, we perform an analysis of retail sales data to gain insights into sales trends and customer purchasing behavior. The dataset used contains sales records for a retail superstore.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Superstore Sales" dataset available on Kaggle. It includes information about sales transactions, such as order date, ship date, product category, quantity, sales, and profit.

### Dataset Link
You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final).

## Project Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - Obtain and load the dataset into Python.
2. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Explore the dataset to understand its structure and clean the data.
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
3. **Data Transformation and Storage**:
   - Transform the data and store it in an SQLite database for efficient querying.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Gain insights into sales trends and customer behavior through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
5. **Report and Visualization**:
   - Present the analysis findings, including recommendations for business improvements.

## Files Included
- `Sample - Superstore.csv`: The raw dataset containing retail sales data.
- `retail_sales.db`: SQLite database file storing the transformed data.
- `Retail_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.

## Visualization Examples
Here are some example visualizations generated from the analysis:
